# StrangerFie

This prototype is built for a concept of group photo-taking with strangers. Anyone is free to stop by and take a photo. After the photo is completed, it can be saved for other purposes _(E.g. publish on social media platforms)._

This is a prototype built for Interaction Design Coursework of BSc IT at UWE, Bristol

# Other Notes (Docker is not usable)

Although Dockerfile and compose.yaml is provided, this package cannot be packed as a docker image/container.

- One of the library (`@imgly/background-removal-node`) is not executable in any docker image
  - Including `node:20` and `node:20-alpine`
- In `node:20-alpine`
  - An error `__vsnprintf_chk: symbol not found` will be thrown
  - Tried installed library `libc6-compat`, `glibc-2.34-r0`, `glibc-2.35-r1`, `gcompat`, `libstdc++`, `gcc`, `g++`, `musl-dev` and `build-base`
  - Issue still not fixed, if you find any way to fix that, please leave a message
- However, in `node:20`, where gnu version of linux with `glibc` is used
  - An error `free() invalid size` is thrown by `@imgly/background-removal-node`
  - Cause: `.wasm` is not read, and it is `{ }` when `free()` is called
  - Same issue reported by others on the repo as well **_(By 13 April 2024)_**.
    - [Issue 103: Ubuntu support](https://github.com/imgly/background-removal-js/issues/103)
    - [Issue 106: Errors while removing background on deployed server](https://github.com/imgly/background-removal-js/issues/106)

## Updates

Docker can be used now, by switching the `@imgly/background-removal-node` to API calls. However the API limits 25 requests per month (Which is 12 photos for this app only).

`@imgly/background-removal-node` can still be used by specifying `BG_REMOVE_METHOD="local"` in the `.env` file. But, it may not be working on other computers.
